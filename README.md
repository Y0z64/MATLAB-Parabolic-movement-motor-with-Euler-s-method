# MATLAB-Parabolic-movement-motor-with-Euler-s-method
This was my 2nd period final project for my "Computational modelation" class.

Features:
- Dinamic velocity and acceleration
- An isometric 3d view of the simulation with a volcano!
- Very crappy code... but im still proud of it.

It was not designed to be modular but some parameters can be changed with the risk of everything breaking and falling apart.
I did it in about 4 hours total and had to rush the 3D view in about 30 minutes.

FOR MATLAB R2022b
